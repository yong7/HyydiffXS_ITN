---

## [13.7.1] - 2022-11-04

### Added

- Document failure of `full` option for TeX Live versions earlier than 2016.

- Add a script `atlas_selfupate.sh` to do the script updating.

### Changed

- Paper and book skeletons do not include `atlastodo` for final version.
  This can lead to an error if notes are still in the document.
  This behaviour is wanted, as such notes should not be included in a public document.
- Start adapting MC snippets to use `siunitx` package consistently.
- Make more use of standard macros in MC snippets such as `\pT, \HT, \mtop`.
- Recommend (and use) `diffcoeff` package rather than `physics`.

- Rename `\ATTeXLive` macro to `\AtlasTeXLive`.
- `atlastodo` package includes `xspace`.

## [10.0.0] - 2020-11-23

The October 2020 LaTeX update led to options being ignored when passed to a document class or a style file if the filename contained a directory.
While this bug will probably be fixed at some point,
it in general appears to be better to adjust the macro `\input@path`
to specify the directory that should be searched for the ATLAS LaTeX packages.
Hence a new style file `atlaslatexpath.sty` has been introduced and should be loaded using

```latex
\RequirePackage{latex/atlaslatexpath}
```

before the `\documentclass`.

### Added

- New style file `atlaslatexpath.sty` to set search path for style files and document class.
- New script `atlaslatex_2020.sh` to make adjustments to main files for TeX Live 2020.

### Changed

- Changed version numbering from 09-03-00 to 10.0.0 (follows Semantic Versioning).
- Templates and documentation switched to use of `atlaslatexpath.sty`.
- `atlaslatex_update.sh` script can self update and checks for use of `\ATLASLATEXPATH` macro.

### Deprecated

- The macro `\ATLASLATEXPATH` should no longer be necessary or be used.

### Removed

- Use of the `\ATLASLATEXPATH` macro in templates and documentation.
- Removed `texmf` targets in `Makefile`, as regular targets work in the same way.

### Fixed

- Block option was being ignored in `atlasbiblatex.sty` as of version 07-01-00.
- Remove a duplicate reference from ATAS-SUSY.bib.
