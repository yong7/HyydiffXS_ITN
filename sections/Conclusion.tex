\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Measurements of Higgs boson fiducial cross-sections in the diphoton decay channel are performed using \pp\ collision data recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC, assuming the Higgs boson mass to be \SI{125.09}{\GeV}.
The data were taken at a centre-of-mass energy of \(\sqrt{s}=\SI{13.6}{\TeV}\) and correspond to the partial Run 3 data set collected between 2022 and 2024 with an integrated luminosity of \SI{165.2}{\femto\barn^{-1}}.

The measurements are performed in a diphoton fiducial region requiring two isolated photons with transverse momentum greater than 35\% and 25\% of the diphoton invariant mass, and with \(|\eta|<2.37\), excluding the region of \(1.37 < |\eta|<1.52\).
The inclusive fiducial cross-section times branching ratio is measured to be \textcolor{red}{to be filled}
%\begin{align*}
%\sigma_\textrm{fid} = 67\pm5~\text{(stat.)}\pm4~\text{(sys.)}~~\si{\femto\barn},
%\end{align*}
%which is in agreement with the Standard Model prediction of \SI[multi-part-units=single]{64\pm 4}{\femto\barn}. The measurement has a total relative uncertainty of 10\% with nearly equal contributions from the statistical and the systematic uncertainties.
%The inclusive fiducial cross-section is also extrapolated to the full phase space, leading to a total Higgs production cross-section of \(58 \pm 4~\text{(stat.)} \pm 4~\text{(sys.)}~\si{\pico\barn}\), in agreement with the SM prediction of \SI[multi-part-units=single]{55.6 \pm 2.7}{\pico\barn}.

In addition, cross-section measurements are reported in various fiducial regions probing Higgs boson production from vector-boson fusion or associated with large missing transverse momentum, leptons or top quarks. The measured cross-sections times branching ratio for the these fiducial regions are: \textcolor{red}{to be filled}
%\begin{align*}
%\sigma_\text{VBF-enhanced}       & = 1.8~~\pm0.5~~~\text{(stat.)} \pm0.3~~~\text{(sys.)}~~\si{\femto\barn}, \\
%\sigma_{N_{\text{lepton} \geq 1}} & = 0.81 \pm0.23~\text{(stat.)} \pm0.06~\text{(sys.)}~~\si{\femto\barn}, \\
%\sigma_{\text{High \met}}             & = 0.28  \pm0.27~\text{(stat.)} \pm0.07~\text{(sys.)}~~\si{\femto\barn}, \\
%\sigma_\text{\ttH-enhanced}        &= 0.53 \pm0.27~\text{(stat.)} \pm0.06~\text{(sys.)}~~\si{\femto\barn}, \\
%\end{align*}
%which show no significant deviation from the Standard Model predictions. The fiducial cross-sections for different inclusive and exclusive jet multiplicities are also measured and compared with different state-of-the-art Standard Model predictions.

Several differential cross-sections are reported for events belonging to the inclusive diphoton fiducial region, as a function of kinematic variables of the diphoton system or of jets produced in association with the Higgs boson. 
These cross-sections are sensitive to the different Higgs boson production kinematics, jet kinematics, spin, and CP quantum numbers of the Higgs boson. Among the measured cross-sections is a new measurement of the cross-section in the high Higgs boson transverse momentum region compared to the Run 2 result \textcolor{red}{TBC}, providing the strongest limits to date for the Higgs boson production cross-section above \SI{600}{\GeV}\textcolor{red}{TBC}. 
%The reported cross-sections include new measurements in regions of the phase space probing jet-veto resummation effects. In addition, four differential cross-sections and one double-differential cross-section were measured for events belonging to the VBF-enhanced region, probing VBF kinematics and CP properties. All the measured differential cross-sections are compared with various Standard Model predictions, and do not exhibit significant deviations from them.
