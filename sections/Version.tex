\subsection*{Changelog}
\begin{itemize}
    \item v0.1: First version of doc for CDS.
    \item v0.2: Updated version. Filling in sections to document work done to-date.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Introduction} provided more specific context for the Run 3 analysis. 

        \item \textbf{Section 3 Object Definitions and Event Selection}: added up-to-date Run3 object descriptions and their references.
        
        \item \textbf{Section 5 Signal and Background modelling}: replaced initial spurious signal studies with a much more advanced study, including proper background decomposition, GPR smoothing and low-stats categories treatment
        
        \item \textbf{Section 6 Background Estimation}: added results for all differential categories.
        
        \item \textbf{Section 7 Uncertainties}: added descriptions of experimental uncertainties. Theoretical uncertainties are still to be evaluated.
        
        \item \textbf{Section 9 Signal Yield Extraction}: added more detailed descriptions to improve clarity.
        
        \item \textbf{Section 11 Conclusion} added a preliminary conclusion paragraph, to be updated once results are finalised.

\section*{To-do list}

Main analysis TO-DO items: 
 \begin{itemize}
     \item Cross-checks with new product cuts; if successful, product cuts will
       be adopted for the analysis
     \item Theoretical uncertainties 
     \end{itemize}
     Other TO-DO items:
     \begin{itemize}
     \item implement GPR smoothing for spurious signal
     \item differential observables for background decomposition
     \item unfolding as opposed to only bin-by-bin corrections
     \item full syst uncertainties as opposed to the simplified scheme
     \item work on analysis CP jira
     \item INT note improvements 
 \end{itemize}
