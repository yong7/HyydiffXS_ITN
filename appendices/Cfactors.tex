The measurement of the fiducial cross-section as a function of a certain particle-level observable 
is performed in a single step through a simultaneous fit of the \mgg{} distribution in all the reco-bins for 
the corresponding detector-level observable. 

For each reco-bin \(r\), the number of selected events originating from Higgs boson diphoton decays \(N_r^{(H)}\) is 
parameterised as a function of the cross-sections under study through the response matrix \(R\):
\begin{equation}
%  N_r^{(H)} = \frac{1}{C_r^\text{fid}}\left[\sum_t L\times(\sigma_{t} \times B_{\gamma\gamma}) \times R_{t,r} \right],
N_r^{(H)} = \sum_t L\times(\sigma_{t} \times B_{\gamma\gamma}) \times R_{t,r},
  \label{eq:unfold1}
\end{equation}
where the sum inside the square brackets represents the number of fiducial signal events reconstructed in the reco-bin \(r\). 
In this formula, \(L\) is the integrated luminosity, and \((\sigma_t \times B_{\gamma\gamma})\) 
is the fiducial Higgs boson production cross-section in the `truth'-bin \(t\) times the Higgs boson diphoton branching ratio, 
where `truth' refers to information from the MC generator's event record. 
The matrix element \(R_{t,r}\) of the response matrix describes the probability to reconstruct 
a signal event originating from a particle-level truth-bin \(t\) in a reconstructed detector-level reco-bin \(r\). 

Two strategies are used to obtain the true number of events: inversion of the matrix $R\_{t,r}$ 
and bin-by-bin corrections. For the bin-by-bin corrections, 
the $C_i$ is a correction factor determined as the ratio between the number of
fiducial events expected to pass the detector level criteria ($n_i^\text{det,fid}$)
and the number expected to pass the corresponding particle level criteria
($n_i^\text{ptcl}$):
\begin{equation}
  C_i = \frac{n_i^\text{det,fid}}{n_i^\text{ptcl}}
  \label{eq:c}
\end{equation}
% Contraty to the Run2 analysis, the MC samples in Run3 do not contain \(H\to f\bar{f}\gamma\) Dalitz decays at the generator level.

The correction factors for the inclusive fiducial regions are: 69.9\% for ggH, 75.8\% for VBF, 150\% for MET, 57.0\% for Lepton and 70.7\% for the ttH selection.
%6.989996653101675506e-01 69.9
%7.577152784981857625e-01 75.8

%5.696950712357270463e-01 57.0
%7.066232190394519108e-01 70.7
These factors are calculated accounting for all production modes and capmapigs (mc23a, mc23d, mc23e). 
The larger than 100\% correction factor for the MET selection is due to the \met{} resolution, which can cause the events to pass the 
\met{} selection requirements, whereas no true \met{} is present at the generator level; the largest contribution to this effect is 
from the ggH production.  
The correction factors for the differential observables are shown in Figures \ref{fig:cfactor_diff_1} -- \ref{fig:cfactor_diff_3}.
