The impact of initial-state radiation (ISR) was evaluated by varying the corresponding parameter of A14 PS tune (Var3c) \cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2014-021,ATL-PHYS-PUB-2017-007}.

The impact of final-state radiation (FSR) was evaluated by
varying the renormalisation scale for emissions from the
parton shower up and down by a factor of two.
