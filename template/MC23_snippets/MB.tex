\chapter{Multiboson processes}
%\label{sec:MB}

In the following paragraphs, the set-ups of the current ATLAS multiboson baseline samples are described.
Details of the full process configuration are given in the PUB note~\cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2017-005}.


\section[Inclusive Powheg]{Inclusive \POWHEG}
%\label{sec:MB-powheg}

The descriptions below correspond to the samples in \cref{tab:MB-powheg}.

\begin{table}[htbp]
  \caption{Inclusive \(VV\) samples with \POWHEG.}%
  \label{tab:MB-powheg}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{l l}
    \toprule
    DSID range & Description \\
    \midrule
    361600--361605 & inclusive \(WW(2\ell 2\nu), WZ(3\ell\nu), ZZ(4\ell), ZZ(4\nu), ZZ(2\ell 2\nu)\) (all lepton flavours)\\
    361606--361611 & inclusive \(WW/WZ/ZZ\) semileptonic decays (\(\ell\ell qq\), \(\ell\nu qq\), \(\nu\nu qq\), all lepton flavours)\\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\paragraph{Description:}

The \POWHEGBOX[v2]~\cite{Nason:2004rx,Frixione:2007vw,Alioli:2010xd} generator
was used to simulate the \(WW\), \(WZ\) and \(ZZ\)~\cite{Nason:2013ydw} production
processes at NLO accuracy in QCD. The effect of singly resonant
amplitudes and interference effects due to \(Z/\gamma^*\) and
same-flavour lepton combinations in the final state were included, where appropriate.
Interference effects between \(WW\) and \(ZZ\) for same-flavour charged leptons and
neutrinos were ignored.
Events were interfaced to \PYTHIA[8.210]~\cite{Sjostrand:2014zea}
for the modelling of the parton shower, hadronisation, and underlying
event, with parameters set according to the \AZNLO
tune~\cite{STDM-2012-23}. The \CT[10] PDF set~\cite{Lai:2010vv} was used
for the hard-scattering processes, whereas the \CTEQ[6L1] PDF
set~\cite{Pumplin:2002vw} was used for the parton shower. The \EVTGEN[1.2.0]
program~\cite{Lange:2001uf} was used to decay bottom and charm hadrons.

The factorisation and renormalisation scales were set to the invariant mass of
the boson pair. An invariant mass of \(m_{\ell\ell} > \qty{4}{\GeV}\) was required
at matrix-element level for any pair of same-flavour charged leptons.


\section[Sherpa]{\SHERPA}
%\label{sec:MB-sherpa}

\subsection{Fully leptonic, semileptonic and loop-induced \texorpdfstring{\(VV\)}{VV}}
%\label{sec:MB-sherpa-fully}

The descriptions below correspond to the samples in
\cref{tab:MB-sherpa}. They describe the almost
identical set-ups of fully leptonic (including loop-induced \(VV\) production)
and semileptonic \(VV\) decays. For loop-induced processes \(gg\to VV\),
the description below assumes that the `nominal' samples with
Higgs contributions are used. If you are using specialised set-ups that
exclude the Higgs component, the description should be modified appropriately.
(Get in touch with the PMG Weak Boson Processes subgroup if you are unsure.)

\begin{table}[htbp]

    364302-364305   & loop-induced semileptonic, using factorised on-shell decays)\\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\paragraph{Description:}

Samples of diboson final states (\(VV\)) were simulated with the
\SHERPA[2.2.1] or 2.2.2~\cite{Bothmann:2019yzt} generator depending on the process,
%~\footnote{This is an admixture of 2.2.1 and above versions, so the version should be kept generic to avoid confusions. As an
%alternative, the sentence can be modified indicating that samples are simulated with the \SHERPA[2.2.1] or 2.2.2 depending on the process.}
including off-shell effects and Higgs boson contributions, where appropriate.
Fully leptonic final states and semileptonic final states, where one boson
decays leptonically and the other hadronically, were generated using
matrix elements at NLO accuracy in QCD for up to one additional parton
and at LO accuracy for up to three additional parton
emissions. Samples for the loop-induced processes \(gg \to VV\) were
generated using LO-accurate matrix elements for up to one
additional parton emission for both the cases of fully leptonic and
semileptonic final states. The matrix element calculations were matched
and merged with the \SHERPA parton shower based on Catani--Seymour
dipole factorisation~\cite{Gleisberg:2008fv,Schumann:2007mg} using the MEPS@NLO
prescription~\cite{Hoeche:2011fd,Hoeche:2012yf,Catani:2001cc,Hoeche:2009rj}.
The virtual QCD corrections were provided by the
\OPENLOOPS library~\cite{Buccioni:2019sur,Cascioli:2011va,Denner:2016kdg}. The
\NNPDF[3.0nnlo] set of PDFs was used~\cite{Ball:2014uwa}, along with the
dedicated set of tuned parton-shower parameters developed by the
\SHERPA authors.


\paragraph{Additional description:}

The ME+PS matching~\cite{Hoeche:2011fd} was employed for different jet
multiplicities which were then merged into an inclusive sample using an
improved CKKW matching procedure~\cite{Catani:2001cc,Hoeche:2009rj}
which is extended to NLO accuracy using the MEPS@NLO
prescription~\cite{Hoeche:2012yf}. The virtual QCD corrections for
matrix elements at NLO accuracy were provided by the
\OPENLOOPS library~\cite{Buccioni:2019sur,Cascioli:2011va,Denner:2016kdg}. The
calculation was performed in the \(G_\mu\) scheme, ensuring an
optimal description of pure electroweak interactions at the
electroweak scale.
